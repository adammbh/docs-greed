# Logging

Configure server event logging to keep track of important actions and changes in your Discord server.

## Logging Channels
- **Logging Channel**: Select the channel where events will be logged.
- **Channel ID**: The Discord channel ID for logging.

## Event Types
Toggle which events you want to log:

- **Message Events**: Messages sent, edited, or deleted.
- **Member Events**: Member joins, leaves, bans, and role changes.
- **Server Events**: Channel, invite, and voice activity.
- **Moderation Events**: Moderation actions like kicks, bans, and mutes.
- **Media Events**: Emoji and sticker changes.

<Note>
You can enable or disable each event type individually. All logs will be sent to the selected logging channel.
