## Embed Scripts
You can use embed scripts from greed.best/embed in your responses. These scripts will be automatically converted to Discord embeds.

## Auto-Responders
- **Trigger**: The word or phrase that will trigger the response.
- **Response**: The message to send when triggered.
- **Strict Match**: Only trigger when the message exactly matches the trigger.
- **Reply to Message**: Reply to the message that triggered the response.

<Note>
You can add multiple auto-responders for different triggers. Use the "+ Add Auto-Responder" button to create new ones.
