# Additional Information:

<Info> 
Greed's dashboard is intensively cached on any API GET routes, meaning users who have just lost their roles may be able to view settings momentarily. **However, they will not be able to update any settings if they do not have permissions at time of request.¹**
</Info>
<Info>
Guilds are cached for 5 to 15 minutes, depending on previous patterns recorded from your hashed IP address.
</Info>
<Warning>
**Please note:** Admins of the server you are trying to access on the Dashboard may have enabled Dashboard logging (`,dashboard logs`) which will send all actions, your User ID and first 15 digits of your **hashed IP address²**
</Warning>
<Warning>
Greed's website utilisies Cloudflare Enterprise's Addon for API routes, hence additional logs may be stored and attempts to breach will be logged.
</Warning>
1: By default `GET` API Requests rely on cached permission checks while `POST` API Requests actively check the permission at the time the request was made.

2: We never store your raw IP Address on our systems, we hash the IPs first then store them. **Hashing is not encryption, a hashed IP address cannot be reversed back to the raw IP address.** [More about hashed IP addresses](https://fidelissecurity.com/cybersecurity-101/learn/what-is-hashing/#:~:text=Hashing%20in%20cybersecurity%20is%20a,sensitive%20information%20from%20unauthorized%20access.)
