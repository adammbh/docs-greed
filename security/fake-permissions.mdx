The Fake Permissions system allows you to grant temporary permissions to roles that can be used through the bot, without actually modifying the role's Discord permissions.

## Requirements

- Bot must have permissions to:
  - Administrator
  - Manage roles
  - View channels
  - Send messages
  - Embed links

## Commands

### View Available Permissions

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,fakepermissions
```

```bash Example
,fakepermissions
```

</CodeGroup>

### Add Fake Permissions

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,fakepermissions add [role] [permission1] [permission2] ...
```

```bash Example
,fakepermissions add @members manage_guild
,fakepermissions add @moderators kick_members ban_members
```

</CodeGroup>

### Remove Fake Permissions

<CodeGroup>

```

```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Fake permissions only work through the bot and do not modify the actual Discord role permissions. Users will still need the actual permissions to perform actions outside of bot commands.
</Warning>

<Note>
You can add multiple permissions to a role at once by separating them with spaces. The permissions will be granted immediately and can be removed at any time.
