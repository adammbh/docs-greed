<Note>
We've introduced a new interactive security setup command! Use `,security` to configure AntiRaid, AntiNuke, and AutoMod settings through an easy-to-use interface.
</Note>

<Warning>
The old configuration methods still work, but we recommend using the new `,security` command for a better setup experience.
