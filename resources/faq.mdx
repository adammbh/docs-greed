## General

### What's the bot prefix?
The default prefix is `,` (comma). If you've set a custom prefix and can't remember it, simply mention the bot (@greed) and it will tell you your server's current prefix.

## Moderation

### How do I remove a hardban from someone?
To remove a hardban, use the same command that applies it. The command will automatically detect if the user is hardbanned and remove it:

```bash
,hardban [user id]
```

If the user is already hardbanned, this will remove the hardban. If they're not, it will apply one.

### How long are snipes stored for?
Snipes are stored in memory using Redis and are kept for:
- Maximum of 2 hours
- Until the bot restarts
- Whichever comes first

## Data & Privacy

### Does Greed automatically delete server data if I remove it?
Yes, Greed automatically cleans up your server data when removed:

1. When Greed detects a 404 error on any feature (autopfp, welcome messages, etc.)
2. It attempts to verify the error 3 more times
3. If the error persists, all server data is automatically deleted from our database

This ensures your data isn't stored unnecessarily after removing the bot.

## Dashboard Access

### How do I access the dashboard?
The dashboard is currently in beta testing and access is limited. To apply for beta access:

1. Visit our [Early Access page](/dashboard/early-access)
2. Follow the application process
3. Wait for approval from our team

We're gradually expanding access to ensure a smooth experience for all users.

## Premium Features

### Does Greed have premium features?
Currently, Greed does not have any premium features. While we plan to introduce premium options in the future, we are committed to:

- Maintaining a great free user experience
- Keeping core features accessible to everyone
- Only adding premium features that enhance rather than restrict functionality

## Scripting System

### Does Greed's script system work with other bots' scripts?
Yes! Greed's scripting system is compatible with scripts from other popular Discord bots. This means you can:

- Use existing scripts from other bots
- Port your scripts from other bots to Greed
- Share scripts between different bot communities

<Note>
While most scripts are compatible, some bot-specific features might require minor adjustments. Check our [Scripting Guide](/resources/scripting) for more details.
