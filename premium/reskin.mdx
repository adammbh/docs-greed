Reskin is a user premium feature, not a guild wide feature. This feature is not enabled by default and requires server admins to enable it.

<Info>
Reskin is a feature which allows users to customise the bot's avatar and name, this is done by utilising Discord Webhooks (messages are sent as Webhooks)
</Info>

## Setting up Reskin in the guild
<Warning>
greed will create a webhook in every channel in the server, if you have enabled antinuke/antiraid in another bot, this might cause greed to get kicked/banned from the server.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```bash Syntax
,reskin setup
```
</CodeGroup>

This will then allow premium **users** that are in your server to use the following commands:
<CodeGroup>
```bash Syntax
,reskin name (name)
,reskin avatar (image)
```

```bash Example
,reskin name greeds sibling
,reskin avatar https://r2.greed.best/greedav.png
```
</CodeGroup>

greed will then send the messages in webhooks, like this:
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/premium/reskin-example.png" />
</Frame>

## Disabling reskin
```bash 
,reskin disable
```

## Deleting reskin
```bash
,reskin delete
```
