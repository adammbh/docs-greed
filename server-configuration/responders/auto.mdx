The Responder (autoresponder) lets you set up custom triggers and automatic replies for your server. Use it to answer frequently asked questions, provide information, or add fun interactions for your community.

## Add a Responder

To add a new responder, use:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,autoresponder add (trigger) (response) [--strict] [--reply]
```

```bash Example
,autoresponder add hello Hi there!
,autoresponder add "how are you" I'm good! --strict --reply
```

</CodeGroup>

- `--strict`: Only triggers on an exact match (not just containing the phrase)
- `--reply`: Makes the bot reply to the message instead of sending a new message

## List Responders

See all responders currently set up in your server:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,autoresponder list
```

```bash Example
,autoresponder list
```

</CodeGroup>

This command will display a list of all triggers, their responses, and any flags.

## Remove a Responder

To remove a responder, use:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,autoresponder remove (trigger)
```

```bash Example
,autoresponder remove hello
```

<Info>
In a new patch released on 14th of June you can now use the numbers on the list, for example: 
`,ar list` would show you the list of autoresponders with numbers next to them such as 01 
You can then run `,ar remove select:01` to remove the first one.
</Info>

</CodeGroup>

Replace `hello` with the trigger you want to remove.

## Clear All Responders

To remove all responders from your server:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,autoresponder clear
```

```bash Example
,autoresponder clear
```

</CodeGroup>

## Available Variables

<Note>
You can use variables in your responder replies, such as `{user}` for the message author. See the [/resources/variables](/resources/variables) page for a full list.
