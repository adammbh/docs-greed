The Command Restrictions feature allows you to limit which roles can use specific commands, providing an additional layer of security and control over command usage.

## Requirements

- Bot must have permissions to:
  - Administrator (for the bot)
  - Administrator (for the user setting restrictions)

<Warning>
Both the bot and the user setting restrictions must have Administrator permissions for this feature to work properly.
</Warning>

## Basic Commands

### Add Restriction

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,restrict add [command], [role]
```

```bash Example
,restrict add ban, @Moderator
,restrict add kick, @Staff
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The command and role must be separated by a comma. The role can be mentioned, named, or ID.
</Note>

### Remove Restriction

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,restrict remove [command], [role]
```

```bash Example
,restrict remove ban, @Moderator
```

</CodeGroup>

### List Restrictions

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,restrict list
```

```bash Example
,restrict list
```

</CodeGroup>

### Reset All Restrictions

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,restrict reset
```

```bash Example
,restrict reset
```

</CodeGroup>

## Features

### Command Control
- Restrict any command to specific roles
- Multiple roles can be restricted for the same command
- Restrictions persist across server restarts
- Easy to manage with clear commands

### Role Management
- Works with any role in the server
- Supports role mentions, names, and IDs
- Can be used with custom roles
- Restrictions are role-based, not user-based

### Security
- Additional layer of command protection
- Prevents unauthorized command usage
- Works alongside Discord's permission system
- Helps maintain server security

<Note>
Command restrictions are in addition to Discord's built-in permission system. Users still need the appropriate Discord permissions to use commands.
</Note>

<Warning>
Make sure to test restrictions after setting them up to ensure they're working as intended. If a command is restricted to a role that no longer exists, the restriction will be automatically removed.
