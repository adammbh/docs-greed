Leave messages let your community know when someone leaves the server. This page explains how to set up, customize, and manage leave messages in Greed.

## Setup

To enable leave messages in your server, run:

```bash
,leave setup
```

This will configure leave messages in the current channel.

## Set the Leave Channel

Set the channel where leave messages will be sent:

```bash
,leave channel #goodbye
```

## Customize the Leave Message

Set your custom leave message with optional auto-delete:

```bash
,leave message Goodbye {user}! --auto_delete 15
```

Auto-delete is optional (1-30 seconds).

## View Current Message

You can check your current leave message configuration at any time:

```bash
,leave view (channel)
```

This command will display your current leave message and its settings.

## Test Leave

Preview your leave message as it will appear to members:

```bash
,leave test (channel)
```

This command will send a test leave message to the configured channel so you can see exactly how it looks.
