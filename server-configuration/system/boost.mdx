Boost messages let your community know when someone boosts the server. This page explains how to set up, customize, and manage boost messages in Greed.

## Setup

To enable boost messages in your server, run:

```bash
,boost setup
```

This will configure boost messages in the current channel.

## Set the Boost Channel

Set the channel where boost messages will be sent:

```bash
,boost channel #boosts
```

## Customize the Boost Message

Set your custom boost message:

```bash
,boost message Thank you for boosting, {user.mention}!
```

You can use embed formatting for advanced messages. Example:

```bash
,boost message {embed}$v{title: Welcome!}{description: Thank you {user.mention} for boosting!}
```

## View Current Message

You can check your current boost message configuration at any time:

```bash
,boost view (channel)
```

This command will display your current boost message and its settings.

## Test Boost

Preview your boost message as it will appear to members:

```bash
,boost test (channel)
```

This command will send a test boost message to the configured channel so you can see exactly how it looks.

## Disable Boost Messages

To disable boost messages:

```bash
,boost reset
```
