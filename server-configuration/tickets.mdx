# Tickets

The Tickets system allows you to create a comprehensive support ticket system with customizable topics, roles, categories, logging, inactivity checks, and DM notifications.

<Note>
The bot requires the **Manage Channels** permission to create and manage tickets.
</Note>

## Setup

### Basic Setup

To set up the ticket system, use the following command:

```bash
,ticket setup #channel
```

<Warning>
You must have the **Manage Server** permission to set up tickets.
</Warning>

### Customizing the Panel

You can customize the ticket panel using the following flags:

```bash
# Basic setup with custom embed
,ticket setup #channel --code "{embed}{color: #2b2d31}$v{title: Create a ticket}$v{description: Click the button below to create a ticket}"

# Custom emojis for buttons
,ticket setup #channel --open=üé´ --delete=üóëÔ∏è
```

<Note>
The code parameter uses the Script system syntax. Visit [greed.best/embed](https://greed.best/embed) to create your embed visually.
</Note>

### Support Role

Set a default support role for tickets:

```bash
,ticket support @role
```

<Note>
This role will have access to:
- Tickets created without a topic
- Topic tickets that have no specific roles assigned
</Note>

### Category

Set a category where tickets will be created:

```bash
,ticket category #category
```

### Topic Configuration

For each topic, you can configure:

   - Multiple roles can be added per topic
   - If no roles are assigned, default support role is used

2. **Category Channel**
   - Set a specific category for tickets in this topic
   - Overrides the default ticket category
   - Useful for organizing different types of tickets

3. **Description**
   - Add a description that users see when selecting the topic
   - Helps users choose the correct topic for their issue

## Ticket Management

### In-Ticket Controls

Each ticket has the following controls:
- **Close** (üîí) - Makes the ticket read-only
- **Transcript** (üìë) - Creates a transcript of the ticket
- **Delete** (üóëÔ∏è) - Permanently deletes the ticket

### User Management

## Best Practices

   - Add descriptive explanations
   - Assign appropriate categories

2. **Role Management**
   - Use topic-specific roles for specialized support
   - Set up a default support role as fallback
   - Ensure proper role hierarchy

3. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Enable comprehensive logging
   - Set appropriate inactivity timeouts
   - Monitor transcript creation

4. **User Experience**
   - Customize embed descriptions
   - Enable DM notifications
   - Organize categories logically

<Note>
Use the interactive UI at greed.best/embed to create beautiful ticket panels with custom colors and formatting.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Permissions**
   - Bot needs **Manage Channels**
   - Support roles need proper permissions
   - Check category permissions

2. **Role Hierarchy**
   - Bot's role must be above support roles
   - Check server role order

3. **Category Access**
   - Verify bot can manage categories
   - Check category permission syncing

4. **Notifications**
   - Users must accept DMs for notifications
   - Check log channel permissions
   - Verify webhook permissions

<Warning>
Always test new configurations in a controlled environment before deploying to production channels.
