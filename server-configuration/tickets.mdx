# Tickets

The Tickets system allows you to create a support ticket system with customizable topics, roles, and categories.

<Note>
The bot requires the **Manage Channels** permission to create and manage tickets.
</Note>

## Setup

### Basic Setup

To set up the ticket system, use the following command:

```bash
,ticket setup #channel
```

<Warning>
You must have the **Manage Server** permission to set up tickets.
</Warning>

### Customizing the Panel

You can customize the ticket panel using the following flags:

```bash
,ticket setup #channel --code="{embed}{color: #2b2d31}$v{title: Create a ticket}$v{description: Click the button below to create a ticket}"
```

<Note>
The code parameter uses the Script system syntax. Visit [greed.best/embed](https://greed.best/embed) to create your embed visually.
</Note>

### Support Role

Set a default support role for tickets:

```bash
,ticket support @role
```

<Note>
This role will have access to:
- Tickets created without a topic
- Topic tickets that have no specific roles assigned
</Note>

### Category

Set a category where tickets will be created:

```bash
,ticket category #category
```

## Ticket Topics

### Adding Topics

Add topics that users can select when creating a ticket:

```bash
,ticket topics
```

<Note>
This will open an interactive menu where you can:
- Add new topics
- Remove existing topics
- Manage topic settings
</Note>

### Topic Settings

For each topic, you can configure:
- Access roles
- Category channel
- Description

<Warning>
If a topic has no specific roles assigned, the default support role will have access.
</Warning>

## Managing Tickets

### Adding Users

Add a user to a ticket:

```bash
,ticket add @user
```

<Note>
The user will be able to view and send messages in the ticket.
</Note>

### Removing Users

Remove a user from a ticket:

```bash
,ticket remove @user
```

<Warning>
The user will lose access to the ticket after being removed.
</Warning>

### Renaming Tickets

Rename a ticket channel:

```bash
,ticket rename new-name
```

### Closing Tickets

Close a ticket:

```bash
,ticket close
```

<Warning>
The ticket channel will be deleted after 5 seconds.
</Warning>

## Settings

### View Settings

Check your ticket settings:

```bash
,ticket settings
```

This will show:
- Support role
- Channel category
- Number of topics
- Opening ticket embed

### Reset System

Reset the ticket system:

```bash
,ticket reset
```

<Warning>
This will disable all existing ticket panels and remove all ticket configurations.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Organize Topics**: Create clear, specific topics to help users select the right category.

2. **Role Management**: Assign appropriate roles to topics to ensure the right staff members have access.

3. **Clear Instructions**: Use the ticket panel embed to provide clear instructions for users.

4. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically check and update your ticket settings and topics.

<Note>
You can use the interactive UI at greed.best/embed to create beautiful ticket panels.
</Note>

## Common Issues

1. **Missing Permissions**: Ensure the bot has the **Manage Channels** permission.

2. **Role Hierarchy**: Make sure the bot's role is above the support role.

3. **Category Access**: Verify the bot has access to the ticket category.

4. **Panel Updates**: Use `,ticket send` to update the ticket panel without changing settings.

<Warning>
Always test the ticket system in a safe environment before deploying it to your main server.
