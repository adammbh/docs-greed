## Features

### Command Matching
- Supports fuzzy matching for command names
- Automatically suggests similar commands if exact match not found
- Preserves command arguments and options

### Alias Rules
- Cannot create aliases for existing commands
- Cannot create aliases that conflict with other aliases
- Aliases are server-specific
- Supports both regular commands and command groups

### Usage Examples
- Create shorter versions of long commands
- Create more intuitive names for complex commands
- Create server-specific command variations

<Note>
- Aliases are processed before command execution
- Command permissions still apply to aliases
- Aliases can be used with command arguments
</Note>

<Warning>
Make sure to use unique aliases that don't conflict with existing commands or other aliases.
