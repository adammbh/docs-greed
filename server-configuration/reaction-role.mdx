The Reaction Roles feature allows you to create interactive role selection menus where users can get roles by reacting to messages with specific emojis.

<Info>
The parameter has been updated from `[message]` to `[message link]` to better reflect its purpose and improve clarity for users.
</Info>
## Requirements

- Bot must have permissions to:
  - Manage roles
  - Add reactions
  - View channels
  - Send messages
  - Embed links

## Basic Commands

### Add Reaction Role

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,reactionrole add [message link] [emoji] [role]
```

```bash Example
,reactionrole add #roles :verified: @Verified
,reactionrole add https://discord.com/channels/1301617147964821524/1373516665186422897/1379749450611822623 :star: @Member
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>

</Note>

### Remove Reaction Role

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,reactionrole remove [message id] [emoji]
```

### List Reaction Roles

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,reactionrole list
```

```bash Example
,reactionrole list
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
In a new patch released on 14th of June you can now use the numbers on the list, for example: 
`,reactionrole list` would show you the list of autoresponders with numbers next to them such as 01 
You can then run `,reactionrole remove select:01` to remove the first one.
</Info>

### Clear All Reaction Roles

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,reactionrole clear
```

```bash Example
,reactionrole clear
```

</CodeGroup>

## Features

### Reaction Role System
- Supports both default and custom emojis
- Works with message links and IDs
- Automatically adds reactions to messages
- Removes roles when reactions are removed

<Warning>
Make sure the bot's role is higher than the roles it's trying to assign. If the bot's role is lower, it won't be able to assign roles.
</Warning>

<Note>
The bot will automatically remove roles when users remove their reactions, maintaining role synchronization.
