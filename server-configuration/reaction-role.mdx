The Reaction Roles feature allows you to create interactive role selection menus where users can get roles by reacting to messages with specific emojis.

## Requirements

- Bot must have permissions to:
  - Manage roles
  - Add reactions
  - View channels
  - Send messages
  - Embed links

## Basic Commands

### Add Reaction Role

## Features

### Reaction Role System
- Supports both default and custom emojis
- Works with message links and IDs
- Automatically adds reactions to messages
- Removes roles when reactions are removed

<Warning>
Make sure the bot's role is higher than the roles it's trying to assign. If the bot's role is lower, it won't be able to assign roles.

The bot will automatically remove roles when users remove their reactions, maintaining role synchronization.
