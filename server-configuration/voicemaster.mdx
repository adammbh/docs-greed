Voicemaster allows users to create and manage their own voice channels with a variety of controls. Users can customize their channels, manage permissions, and control who can join their voice channels.

## Requirements

- Server must have at least one text channel for the Voicemaster menu
- Bot must have permissions to:
  - Manage channels
  - View channels
  - Send messages
  - Manage permissions
  - Move members

## Setup

To set up Voicemaster in your server:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,voicemaster setup
```

```bash Example
,voicemaster setup
```

</CodeGroup>

This will create:
- A "vm" category
- A "menu" text channel with the control panel
- A "create" voice channel for creating new voice channels

## Voice Channel Controls

Once you join the "create" voice channel, you'll get your own voice channel with the following controls:

### Lock/Unlock
- Lock your channel to prevent others from joining
- Unlock to allow others to join again

### Hide/Reveal
- Hide your channel from the channel list
- Reveal to make it visible again

### Rename
- Change your voice channel's name

### Claim
- Claim ownership of a voice channel if the owner leaves

### User Limit
- Increase/decrease the maximum number of users allowed
- Set a specific limit using the limit command

### Information
- View details about your voice channel including:
  - Bitrate
  - Member count
  - Creation date
  - Owner

### Delete
- Delete your voice channel

## Additional Commands

### Set Channel Template

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,voicemaster template (template)
```

```bash Example
,voicemaster template {owner}'s channel
```

</CodeGroup>

Available variables:
- `{owner}` - Channel owner's name
- `{count}` - Number of members in channel

### Temporary Channels

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,voicemaster temporary
```

```bash Example
,voicemaster temporary
```

</CodeGroup>

Toggle automatic deletion of empty voice channels.

### User Management

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,voicemaster permit (user)
,voicemaster reject (user)
,voicemaster drag (user)
```

```bash Example
,voicemaster permit @user
,voicemaster reject @user
,voicemaster drag @user
```

</CodeGroup>

- `permit`: Allow a user to join your channel
- `reject`: Remove a user and prevent them from joining
- `drag`: Move a user to your voice channel

<Note>
Channel owners have full control over their voice channels, including the ability to manage permissions and kick users.
