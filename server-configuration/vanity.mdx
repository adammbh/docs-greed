The Vanity feature is powered by our partnership with [Prox](https://prox.bot), a powerful vanity URL management bot. This integration allows you to manage vanity URL settings and rewards for your server, including welcome messages, channels, and role rewards.

## Requirements

- [Prox Bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1376549720553558106&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=8) must be in your server
- Bot must have permissions to:
  - Send messages
  - Embed links
  - Manage roles
  - View channels
  - Manage webhooks

<Note>
You must invite Prox to your server before using any vanity features. Greed will automatically detect if Prox is present and guide you through the setup process.
</Note>

## Setup

### Invite Prox

First, you need to invite Prox to your server. You can do this by:
1. Clicking the [Prox Bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1376549720553558106&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=8) link
2. Selecting your server
3. Authorizing the bot

<Warning>
Make sure to give Prox the necessary permissions during the invite process. The bot requires administrator permissions to function properly.
</Warning>

### Set Up Vanity URL

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,vanity setup <vanity>
```

```bash Example
,vanity setup greed
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The vanity URL must be unique across all Discord servers. If your chosen vanity is already taken, you'll need to choose a different one.
</Note>

,vanity message <message>
```

```bash Example
,vanity message {embed}$v{title: Thank you {user.mention} for repping /{vanity}!}

<Note>
Welcome messages support Greed's powerful script system, allowing you to create rich, dynamic messages with embeds, variables, and more.
</Note>

### Set Welcome Channel

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,vanity channel <channel>
```

</Note>
