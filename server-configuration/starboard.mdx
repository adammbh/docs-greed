The Starboard feature allows you to create a collection of highly-reacted messages in a dedicated channel. When messages receive enough reactions (meeting the threshold), they are automatically posted to the starboard channel. This is perfect for highlighting community favorites, important announcements, or memorable moments.

## Requirements

- Server must have at least one text channel for the starboard
- Bot must have permissions to:
  - Read messages
  - Send messages
  - Add reactions
  - Manage messages (for editing/updating starboard entries)
  - View channels
  - Read message history

## Add a Starboard

To create a new starboard channel:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,starboard add (channel) (emoji) (threshold)
```

```bash Example
,starboard add #starboard ‚≠ê 5
,starboard add #memes ü§° 3
```

</CodeGroup>

- `channel`: The channel where starboard messages will be posted
- `emoji`: The reaction emoji to track (can be any valid emoji)
- `threshold`: Minimum number of reactions required to appear in starboard

## List Starboards

View all starboards currently set up in your server:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,starboard list
```

```bash Example
,starboard list
```

</CodeGroup>

This will show all starboard channels, their associated emojis, and reaction thresholds.

## Remove a Starboard

To remove a starboard:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,starboard remove (channel) (emoji)
```

```bash Example
,starboard remove #starboard ‚≠ê
```

</CodeGroup>

## Ignore Channels

You can prevent certain channels from being added to the starboard:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,starboard ignore (channel)
,starboard unignore (channel)
```

```bash Example
,starboard ignore #announcements
,starboard unignore #announcements
```

</CodeGroup>

## Move Starboard

To move a starboard to a different channel:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Syntax
,starboard move (emoji) (channel)
```

```bash Example
,starboard move ‚≠ê #new-starboard
```

</CodeGroup>

## Special Features

### Star Emoji Progression

When using the ‚≠ê emoji, the starboard will automatically upgrade the emoji based on reaction count:
- 0-4 reactions: ‚≠ê
- 5-9 reactions: üåü
- 10-24 reactions: üí´
- 25+ reactions: ‚ú®

### Message Format

Starboard entries include:
- Original message content
- Author information
- Channel source
- Jump link to original message
- Reaction count
- Attached images/videos
- Reply context (if the message was a reply)

### Batch Processing

The starboard uses a batch processing system to handle reactions efficiently:
- Reactions are queued and processed every 5 seconds
- Messages are processed in chunks of 5 to prevent rate limiting
- Updates are batched to minimize API calls

<Note>
Starboard messages are automatically updated when reaction counts change, and they're removed if the reaction count falls below the threshold.
</Note>

<Warning>
Deleting a starboard channel will automatically remove its configuration. Make sure to properly remove starboards using the remove command before deleting channels.
